# Raspberry Pi Pico Birthday Card

This code is for the Raspberry Pi Pico powered Birthday card project.

There are a few programs to test out each part of the card functionality, these are:

* [`buzzer_demo`](buzzer_demo.py) - plays the happy birthday tune
* [`cake.py`](cake.py) - Shows the cake image on the 5x5 display
* [`font.py`](font.py) - This file contains all `jonny five` font thats specifically designed for the 5x5 display
* [`touch.py`](touch.py) - displays `touched` or `not touched` using the touch sensor
* [`scroll.py`](scroll.py) - displays scrolling text on the 5x5 display

All these programs need to be uploaded to the Pico for the `happy_birthday.py` to work on the Pico. You can rename this to `main.py` for it to run automatically.
